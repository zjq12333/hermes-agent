# Plugins

Hermes has a plugin system for adding custom tools, hooks, and integrations without modifying core code.

**→ [Build a Hermes Plugin](/docs/guides/build-a-hermes-plugin)** — step-by-step guide with a complete working example.

## Quick overview

Drop a directory into `~/.hermes/plugins/` with a `plugin.yaml` and Python code:

```
~/.hermes/plugins/my-plugin/
├── plugin.yaml      # manifest
├── __init__.py      # register() — wires schemas to handlers
├── schemas.py       # tool schemas (what the LLM sees)
└── tools.py         # tool handlers (what runs when called)
```

Start Hermes — your tools appear alongside built-in tools. The model can call them immediately.

### Minimal working example

Here is a complete plugin that adds a `hello_world` tool and logs every tool call via a hook.

**`~/.hermes/plugins/hello-world/plugin.yaml`**

```yaml
name: hello-world
version: "1.0"
description: A minimal example plugin
```

**`~/.hermes/plugins/hello-world/__init__.py`**

```python
"""Minimal Hermes plugin — registers a tool and a hook."""


def register(ctx):
    # --- Tool: hello_world ---
    schema = {
        "name": "hello_world",
        "description": "Returns a friendly greeting for the given name.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "name": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Name to greet",
                }
            },
            "required": ["name"],
        },
    }

    def handle_hello(params):
        name = params.get("name", "World")
        return f"Hello, {name}! 👋  (from the hello-world plugin)"

    ctx.register_tool("hello_world", schema, handle_hello)

    # --- Hook: log every tool call ---
    def on_tool_call(tool_name, params, result):
        print(f"[hello-world] tool called: {tool_name}")

    ctx.register_hook("post_tool_call", on_tool_call)
```

Drop both files into `~/.hermes/plugins/hello-world/`, restart Hermes, and the model can immediately call `hello_world`. The hook prints a log line after every tool invocation.

Project-local plugins under `./.hermes/plugins/` are disabled by default. Enable them only for trusted repositories by setting `HERMES_ENABLE_PROJECT_PLUGINS=true` before starting Hermes.

## What plugins can do

| Capability | How |
|-----------|-----|
| Add tools | `ctx.register_tool(name, schema, handler)` |
| Add hooks | `ctx.register_hook("post_tool_call", callback)` |
| Add slash commands | `ctx.register_command(name, handler, description)` — adds `/name` in CLI and gateway sessions |
| Add CLI commands | `ctx.register_cli_command(name, help, setup_fn, handler_fn)` — adds `hermes <plugin> <subcommand>` |
| Inject messages | `ctx.inject_message(content, role="user")` — see [Injecting Messages](#injecting-messages) |
| Ship data files | `Path(__file__).parent / "data" / "file.yaml"` |
| Bundle skills | `ctx.register_skill(name, path)` — namespaced as `plugin:skill`, loaded via `skill_view("plugin:skill")` |
| Gate on env vars | `requires_env: [API_KEY]` in plugin.yaml — prompted during `hermes plugins install` |
| Distribute via pip | `[project.entry-points."hermes_agent.plugins"]` |

## Plugin discovery

| Source | Path | Use case |
|--------|------|----------|
| Bundled | `<repo>/plugins/` | Ships with Hermes — see [Built-in Plugins](/docs/user-guide/features/built-in-plugins) |
| User | `~/.hermes/plugins/` | Personal plugins |
| Project | `.hermes/plugins/` | Project-specific plugins (requires `HERMES_ENABLE_PROJECT_PLUGINS=true`) |
| pip | `hermes_agent.plugins` entry_points | Distributed packages |

Later sources override earlier ones on name collision, so a user plugin with the same name as a bundled plugin replaces it.

## Plugins are opt-in

**Every plugin — user-installed, bundled, or pip — is disabled by default.** Discovery finds them (so they show up in `hermes plugins` and `/plugins`), but nothing loads until you add the plugin's name to `plugins.enabled` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`. This stops anything with hooks or tools from running without your explicit consent.

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled:
    - my-tool-plugin
    - disk-cleanup
  disabled:       # optional deny-list — always wins if a name appears in both
    - noisy-plugin
```

Three ways to flip state:

```bash
hermes plugins                    # interactive toggle (space to check/uncheck)
hermes plugins enable <name>      # add to allow-list
hermes plugins disable <name>     # remove from allow-list + add to disabled
```

After `hermes plugins install owner/repo`, you're asked `Enable 'name' now? [y/N]` — defaults to no. Skip the prompt for scripted installs with `--enable` or `--no-enable`.

### Migration for existing users

When you upgrade to a version of Hermes that has opt-in plugins (config schema v21+), any user plugins already installed under `~/.hermes/plugins/` that weren't already in `plugins.disabled` are **automatically grandfathered** into `plugins.enabled`. Your existing setup keeps working. Bundled plugins are NOT grandfathered — even existing users have to opt in explicitly.

## Available hooks

Plugins can register callbacks for these lifecycle events. See the **[Event Hooks page](/docs/user-guide/features/hooks#plugin-hooks)** for full details, callback signatures, and examples.

| Hook | Fires when |
|------|-----------|
| [`pre_tool_call`](/docs/user-guide/features/hooks#pre_tool_call) | Before any tool executes |
| [`post_tool_call`](/docs/user-guide/features/hooks#post_tool_call) | After any tool returns |
| [`pre_llm_call`](/docs/user-guide/features/hooks#pre_llm_call) | Once per turn, before the LLM loop — can return `{"context": "..."}` to [inject context into the user message](/docs/user-guide/features/hooks#pre_llm_call) |
| [`post_llm_call`](/docs/user-guide/features/hooks#post_llm_call) | Once per turn, after the LLM loop (successful turns only) |
| [`on_session_start`](/docs/user-guide/features/hooks#on_session_start) | New session created (first turn only) |
| [`on_session_end`](/docs/user-guide/features/hooks#on_session_end) | End of every `run_conversation` call + CLI exit handler |
| [`pre_gateway_dispatch`](/docs/user-guide/features/hooks#pre_gateway_dispatch) | Gateway received a user message, before auth + dispatch. Return `{"action": "skip" \| "rewrite" \| "allow", ...}` to influence flow. |

## Plugin types

Hermes has three kinds of plugins:

| Type | What it does | Selection | Location |
|------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **General plugins** | Add tools, hooks, slash commands, CLI commands | Multi-select (enable/disable) | `~/.hermes/plugins/` |
| **Memory providers** | Replace or augment built-in memory | Single-select (one active) | `plugins/memory/` |
| **Context engines** | Replace the built-in context compressor | Single-select (one active) | `plugins/context_engine/` |

Memory providers and context engines are **provider plugins** — only one of each type can be active at a time. General plugins can be enabled in any combination.

## Managing plugins

```bash
hermes plugins                               # unified interactive UI
hermes plugins list                          # table: enabled / disabled / not enabled
hermes plugins install user/repo             # install from Git, then prompt Enable? [y/N]
hermes plugins install user/repo --enable    # install AND enable (no prompt)
hermes plugins install user/repo --no-enable # install but leave disabled (no prompt)
hermes plugins update my-plugin              # pull latest
hermes plugins remove my-plugin              # uninstall
hermes plugins enable my-plugin              # add to allow-list
hermes plugins disable my-plugin             # remove from allow-list + add to disabled
```

### Interactive UI

Running `hermes plugins` with no arguments opens a composite interactive screen:

```
Plugins
  ↑↓ navigate  SPACE toggle  ENTER configure/confirm  ESC done

  General Plugins
 → [✓] my-tool-plugin — Custom search tool
   [ ] webhook-notifier — Event hooks
   [ ] disk-cleanup — Auto-cleanup of ephemeral files [bundled]

  Provider Plugins
     Memory Provider          ▸ honcho
     Context Engine           ▸ compressor
```

- **General Plugins section** — checkboxes, toggle with SPACE. Checked = in `plugins.enabled`, unchecked = in `plugins.disabled` (explicit off).
- **Provider Plugins section** — shows current selection. Press ENTER to drill into a radio picker where you choose one active provider.
- Bundled plugins appear in the same list with a `[bundled]` tag.

Provider plugin selections are saved to `config.yaml`:

```yaml
memory:
  provider: "honcho"      # empty string = built-in only

context:
  engine: "compressor"    # default built-in compressor
```

### Enabled vs. disabled vs. neither

Plugins occupy one of three states:

| State | Meaning | In `plugins.enabled`? | In `plugins.disabled`? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | Loaded on next session | Yes | No |
| `disabled` | Explicitly off — won't load even if also in `enabled` | (irrelevant) | Yes |
| `not enabled` | Discovered but never opted in | No | No |

The default for a newly-installed or bundled plugin is `not enabled`. `hermes plugins list` shows all three distinct states so you can tell what's been explicitly turned off vs. what's just waiting to be enabled.

In a running session, `/plugins` shows which plugins are currently loaded.

## Injecting Messages

Plugins can inject messages into the active conversation using `ctx.inject_message()`:

```python
ctx.inject_message("New data arrived from the webhook", role="user")
```

**Signature:** `ctx.inject_message(content: str, role: str = "user") -> bool`

How it works:

- If the agent is **idle** (waiting for user input), the message is queued as the next input and starts a new turn.
- If the agent is **mid-turn** (actively running), the message interrupts the current operation — the same as a user typing a new message and pressing Enter.
- For non-`"user"` roles, the content is prefixed with `[role]` (e.g. `[system] ...`).
- Returns `True` if the message was queued successfully, `False` if no CLI reference is available (e.g. in gateway mode).

This enables plugins like remote control viewers, messaging bridges, or webhook receivers to feed messages into the conversation from external sources.

:::note
`inject_message` is only available in CLI mode. In gateway mode, there is no CLI reference and the method returns `False`.
