"""Process-wide voice recording + TTS API for the TUI gateway.

Wraps ``tools.voice_mode`` (recording/transcription) and ``tools.tts_tool``
(text-to-speech) behind idempotent, stateful entry points that the gateway's
``voice.record``, ``voice.toggle``, and ``voice.tts`` JSON-RPC handlers can
call from a dedicated thread. The gateway imports this module lazily so that
missing optional audio deps (sounddevice, faster-whisper, numpy) surface as
an ``ImportError`` at call time, not at startup.

Two usage modes are exposed:

* **Push-to-talk** (``start_recording`` / ``stop_and_transcribe``) — single
  manually-bounded capture used when the caller drives the start/stop pair
  explicitly.
* **Continuous (VAD)** (``start_continuous`` / ``stop_continuous``) — mirrors
  the classic CLI voice mode: recording auto-stops on silence, transcribes,
  hands the result to a callback, and then auto-restarts for the next turn.
  Three consecutive no-speech cycles stop the loop and fire
  ``on_silent_limit`` so the UI can turn the mode off.
